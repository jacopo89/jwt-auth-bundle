##News

###Version 1.2 release

- PSR-4 compliance
- Support for API v2 & auth0-php 1.0

#### BC breaks

- Config
    - package name space changed to `jwt_auth`
    - added optional `secret_base64_encoded` field
- Removed dependency with Auth0. Now you can use non base64 tokens.
- The profile data is not longer a `stdClass`, is an asociative array.
- There are some BC issues related to the auth0-php changes. We recomment to read the [auth0-php README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0-PHP).

#### Auth0 integration

This package has built in Auth0 integration (as you can check on the example) but is not mandatory. You can use this package to authenticate other JWT.

The auth-php SDK is used to decode the JWT and if you are woking with Auth0 you can inject to your `UserProvider` to get the user profile (as you can check on the [example](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-auth-bundle/blob/master/example/src/AppBundle/Security/A0UserProvider.php)).
